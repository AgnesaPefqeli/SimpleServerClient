# Contributing Guidelines

## Code Style
- Do not use a single line for a {, but put it at the end of the previous line
- Do not leave { or } out even if this is possible, e.g. when writing an if statement with just one line in its body
- Do not change the line breaks of the Javadoc

## Java Version
- Only use language features that are possible in Java 8 or earlier.
